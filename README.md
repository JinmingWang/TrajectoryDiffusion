# TrajectoryDiffusion
Apply diffusion models to trajectory tasks
Try to implement 

# TODO
- [ ] Push dataset pre-processing code (C++)
- [ ] Check data distribution, normalize trajectries using z-score normalization (time, lat, lon)
- [ ] Add code to write log during training
- [ ] Implement generation (denoising) process
- [ ] Do Training
- [ ] Implement JSD score to compare generated dataset and real dataset
