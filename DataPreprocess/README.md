# Data Preprocessing

This folder contains some data pre-processing C++ code.

First, you should have original didi data, they are stored in files with name like "gps_YYYYMMDD".

Second, you need libtorch or a python environment with pytorch to run this. Alternatively, you can also try to rewrite the program in python, but just make sure you have enough memory to process the data.
